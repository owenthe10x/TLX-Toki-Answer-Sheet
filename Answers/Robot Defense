Description
Xima has finally made a robot that can move in 2-dimensional space.
Initially, the robot is located at the point (0,0). The robot is given a series of operations. Each operation is a capital letter, explained below:
R: Right → the robot moves from (x, y) to (x+1, y).
L: Left → the robot moves from (x, y) to (x-1, y).
U: Up → the robot moves from (x, y) to (x, y+1).
D: Down → the robot moves from (x, y) to (x, y-1).
Any other operation will be ignored by the robot.
The series of operations will be given to the robot in the form of a string S. After every operation has been done, the robot will stop.
However, the robot moves as slow as a snail, and Xima is impatient to wait for the robot to finish every operation given.
Xima wants to know where the robot will stop after it has done every operation. Can you help Xima?

Input Format
The input is given in the following format:
S
Output Format
Two integers denoting the coordinate where the robot will stop.

Sample Input 1
RUDDLDUR
Sample Output 1
1 -1

Sample Input 2
ABRUMNURYZ
Sample Output 2
2 2

Explanation
In the first sample, the movement of the robot will be as follows:
R: (0, 0) to (1, 0)
U: (1, 0) to (1, 1)
D: (1, 1) to (1, 0)
D: (1, 0) to (1, -1)
L: (1, -1) to (0, -1)
D: (0, -1) to (0, -2)
U: (0, -2) to (0, -1)
R: (0, -1) to (1, -1), and the robot stops.
Therefore, the output is 1 -1.

In the second sample, characters other than R, L, U, and D are ignored by the robot, so it will only execute the third, fourth, seventh, and eighth operations, 
which are R, U, U, and R.

Constraints
1 ≤ |S| ≤ 100, where |S| is the length of the string S.
S contains capital letters only (the letters 'A' - 'Z').
